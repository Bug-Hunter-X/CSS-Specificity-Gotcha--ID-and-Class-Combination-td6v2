The following CSS code has an uncommon error related to the specificity of selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red; 
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

#my-id.container {
  color: purple;
}
```

The intended behavior is that `#my-id.container` should override other selectors due to its higher specificity. However, if the element with id "my-id" is *not* within an element with class "container", the selector `#my-id.container` will have no effect.
