# CSS Specificity Issue: Unexpected Behavior with ID and Class Selectors

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to CSS selector specificity.  The problem arises when using an ID selector in combination with a class selector, where the intended specificity might not be achieved if the element doesn't match both parts of the selector.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential fix to resolve this scenario. 

This situation is uncommon, hence easily missed by developers. The solution involves restructuring the CSS rules to maintain clarity and ensure the desired specificity.
